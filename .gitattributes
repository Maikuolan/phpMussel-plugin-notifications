# Which EOL is best could be easily debated for or against any one way or
# another, which is, perhaps, the reason why those various OS adopted by the
# wider IT community don't follow any one particular strict standard, with
# Windows defaulting to CRLF, Unix/Linux to LF, and so on and so forth.
# Although I do the vast bulk of my coding via a Windows machine, and by
# extension, it might be assumed I prefer CRLF, contrarily, I personally
# prefer LF over CRLF or any other alternatives, due in part to my own personal
# experiences and in part to my desire to minimise the overall size of the
# phpMussel package. Linux users shouldn't normally have any issue reading
# files that use LF linebreaks, but, for Windows users, to avoid issues
# readings these files, I'd recommend using Notepad++ for opening and reading
# these files, because, unlike traditional Notepad or other similar native
# text readers/editors, Notepad++ has no difficulties in readning textfiles of
# of various linebreak types (TXT and INI files will remain as CRLF, however).
